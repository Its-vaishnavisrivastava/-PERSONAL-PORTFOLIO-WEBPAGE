**I designed and developed a **single-page developer portfolio website** using **HTML and CSS** entirely in **Visual Studio Code**, making use of the **Live Server** extension for real-time preview during development. The layout includes a navigation bar, an introduction section with an animated text effect (powered by the Typed.js library from a CDN), a work experience section displaying different skill areas, and a footer with quick navigation links. I styled the site using pure CSS, implementing responsive design techniques like Flexbox for layout alignment, hover effects for navigation links, and consistent typography using **Google Fonts (Poppins)** for a professional look. The images and icons were sourced locally, while some UI inspiration came from Google search results and design references. I relied on **MDN Web Docs** for CSS property references and HTML best practices, and on the Typed.js documentation to implement the typing animation. All coding, structuring, and styling decisions were made by me based on my understanding, while online resources served as a guide for syntax and creative ideas. The final product is a clean, responsive, and visually engaging portfolio website that effectively showcases a developerâ€™s profile and projects.**
